/*  Execute this file from the command line by typing:
 *    mysql -u <USER> < db/sql/setup.sql
 *    OR
 *    mysql -u <USER> -p < sql/sequelize/setup.sql
 *  For example, on a pairing station, it'll be 
 *    mysql -u student -p < sql/sequelize/setup.sql
 *  and then you'll have to enter the password, student
 *  On your personal computer, if you haven't set up
 *  a password, it'll be 
 *    mysql -u root < sql/sequelize/setup.sql
 *
 *  If you need assistance with this step,
